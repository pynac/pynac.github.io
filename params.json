{"name":"Pynac","tagline":"symbolic computation with Python objects","body":"### What is Pynac?\r\n\r\nPynac is a derivative of the C++ library [GiNaC](http://www.ginac.de/), which allows manipulation of symbolic expressions. It currently provides the backend for symbolic expressions in [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/). In order to use Pynac, one needs to have the Sage library available.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between Pynac and GiNaC is that Pynac relies on Sage to provide the operations on numerical types, while GiNaC depends on [CLN](http://www.ginac.de/CLN/) for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Pynac came to be, and the differences between Pynac and GiNaC, please visit the [FAQ page](http://pynac.org/faq.html).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nPynac is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), distributed under the terms and conditions of the [GNU general public license (GPL) version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html), or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n* [Google Groups Contact / Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/pynac-devel)\r\n* [Contributors](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/Pynac-Contributors)\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
