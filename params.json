{"name":"Pynac","tagline":"symbolic computation with Python objects","body":"### What is Pynac?\r\n\r\nPynac is a derivative of the C++ library [GiNaC](http://www.ginac.de/), which allows manipulation of symbolic expressions. It currently provides the backend for symbolic expressions in [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/). In order to use Pynac, one needs to have the Sage library available.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between Pynac and GiNaC is that Pynac relies on Sage to provide the operations on numerical types, while GiNaC depends on [CLN](http://www.ginac.de/CLN/) for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how Pynac came to be, and the differences between Pynac and GiNaC, please visit the [FAQ page](http://pynac.org/faq.html).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nPynac is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), distributed under the terms and conditions of the [GNU general public license (GPL) version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html), or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n* [Google Groups Contact / Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/pynac-devel)\r\n* [Contributors](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/Pynac-Contributors)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
